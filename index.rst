The Divi Builder comes in two forms: The standard “Back-end Builder” and the front-end “Visual Builder.” Both interfaces allow you to build exactly the same types of websites with the same content elements and design settings. The only difference is the interface. The Back-end Builder lives inside of the WordPress Dashboard and it can be accessed along with all of the other standard WordPress settings. It sits inside the WordPress UI and replaces the standard WordPress post editor. It’s great for making quick changes while you are inside the dashboard, but it’s also confined by the dashboard and is rendered as a block-based representation of your website. This tutorial will be focusing only on the visual builder.
